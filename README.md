### Executive Pitch  
An end-to-end IoT pipeline that turns plant care from guesswork into data-driven decisions. Built to show how sensor data can flow seamlessly from hardware to database to API to live dashboardsâ€”scalable from one houseplant to an agricultural network.  

Plants often fail silently, costing time, money, and yield. Plant Pipeline reframes plant health as a data problem. By tracking soil moisture, light, temperature, and humidity in real time, it provides actionable insights, alerts, and predictive forecastsâ€”like a patient monitor, but for plants.  

> **Origin Story:** My dieffenbachiaâ€™s soil would crash from ~40% to 25% moisture unpredictably, leaving me guessing when to water. With this system, I caught the drying pattern early, stopped the yellowing, and now the plantâ€™s producing healthy new leaves.  

### Business Value  
- **For individuals:** anticipate issues, water smarter, and reduce waste.  
- **For organizations:** a reproducible IoT pipeline template that demonstrates how to capture, store, and act on sensor dataâ€”transferable to agriculture, industrial IoT, and smart devices.  

### Technical Value  
- End-to-end ownership of a full stack: Arduino â†’ Python ingestion â†’ SQLite â†’ FastAPI â†’ web dashboard.  
- Hardware-optional design via a **probe simulator**, enabling instant demos and rapid prototyping without physical sensors.  
- Extensible roadmap: alerts, machine learning forecasts, wireless deployment, containerization.  

This project demonstrates both **hands-on engineering depth** and the ability to **translate technical work into business outcomes**â€”bridging the gap between raw data pipelines and real-world value.

## Demo (5-minute Quickstart)  

> No hardware required. This uses an **arduino mimic** that writes oscillating sensor values to a virtual serial port.  

```bash
# 1) Clone
git clone https://github.com/MahonriReynolds/plant-pipeline
cd plant-pipeline

# 2) Python deps (3.10+)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3) Create a paired virtual serial port (Linux/macOS)
# This prints two PTY device paths; keep this terminal open.
# Example output shows: PTY is /dev/pts/3 & PTY is /dev/pts/4
socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0

# 4) In a new terminal: start the fake probe, writing to the SECOND device
python arduino_mimic.py --port /dev/pts/4 --interval 2

# 5) In another terminal: start the pipe (src/plantpipe/core/pipe.py), setting PROBE_PORT to the FIRST device:
# DB_PATH = "data/plant.db"
# SCHEMA_PATH = "sql/001_init.sql"

# ** PROBE_PORT = "/dev/pts/3" **

# BAUD = 115200
# API_HOST = "127.0.0.1"
# ...

python pipe.py

# 6) Open the dashboard
http://localhost:8000/frontend
